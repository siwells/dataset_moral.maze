A group of experts convened by the London School of Economics claims nearly half of all illness in the under 65s is mental; that six million people in this country have depression, or crippling anxiety; and that three quarters of them go untreated. The wealthier we get, the unhappier we seem to be they say, and they make an economic as well as medical case for expanding mental health treatment.  First of all, is this true? Or are we merely medicalising the glum, the shy, and the badly behaved? Maybe, in our blame resistant times, relieving them of being moral agents for their own behaviour. If it is true, oughtn\u2019t we to address the underlying causes of such widespread distress, rather than, or at least as well as, trying to drug and talk them out of it. Try to glue back an atomising society; rebuild broken families, raise our ambitions beyond vapid consumerism, perhaps rediscover religion.  Shouldn\u2019t we try to work out what makes us happy and put it on the school curriculum? Are we really less able to cope than previous generations? What does it say about us, and how can we make it better?  That\u2019s our \u2018moral maze\u2019 tonight. The panel: Melanie Philips, social commentator on the Daily Mail; the former conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo; Claire Fox, from the Institute of Ideas; and Matthew Taylor, formerly Tony Blair\u2019s chief political advisor, now Chief Executive of the RSA.  Claire Fox, does this report make sense to you?"

Our first witness is Professor Lord Layard, Richard Layard, who is director of the wellbeing programme at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, and the man behind this report.

To look at it\u2019s importance, we include when we are trying to explain whether people are satisfied or not with their lives, things like their family situation, their job situation, and so on. We also include their physical health, we include their income. And then we include, not their current mental illness because that\u2019s obviously begging a question, but their mental illness eight, ten years\u2019 earlier. Their mental scale; how they were on a mental scale of malaise. And that is the dominating influence affecting how miserable a person is now. Four times more powerful than their current income, and twice as powerful as how many physical illnesses they have. So this is a root dimension of the human situation, which we have not been willing to take seriously, I think because we\u2019ve not been willing to think it could be studied in scientific way.  Now, I\u2019m an economist, I\u2019m from outside this world, but what has really impressed me is the quality of the science with which these people operate. Both in the diagnosis, which is done scientifically, it\u2019s not self diagnosis, there\u2019s no incentive for anybody to diagnose themselves, they\u2019re diagnosed by a researcher."

What has struck me though, is that in spite of big improvements \u2013 I mean you\u2019re wrong to say that everything\u2019s been getting worse over the last thirty years, apart from this current recession. Most of the typical indicators that Beveridge would have looked at: standards of education, housing, income and so on, have improved a lot.

Neither I think, is the situation helped by the way that much research uses terms such as \u2018mental illness\u2019, \u2018mental disorder\u2019, \u2018metal health problems\u2019 interchangeably.

Some do, and some young people do work with us for treatment around their mental health, and wherever possible the integrate model which we\u2019ve developed advocates that it\u2019s not just about working with the individual, it\u2019s also about working with some of the societal causes that might have contributed to the young person\u2019s difficulties.  So what we advocate for, is intervention at an individual level where it\u2019s necessary, and that intervention is led by what the young person wants support with. But also working at a more organisational level, because we recognise we can work with these young people until we\u2019re blue in the face, but if things around them don\u2019t change, then actually it\u2019s really challenging for some of these people to move forwards with their lives."

Michael Portillo, you dragged him over this area of what you perceive to be, or suggested was self-definition of mental illness. What were you getting at? And to what extent did Lord Layard satisfy you on that score?"

I\u2019m not for a moment denying that mental illness exists, or indeed denying that it\u2019s widespread. Personally I find it difficult to believe that it\u2019s six million. I didn\u2019t find evidence form Lord Layard that it was six million, except apparently on the basis that people have been asked 26 questions. Well, I don\u2019t think 26 questions in which people detail their various unhappiness\u2019 is enough for me to be convinced.  And then secondly, the main point that he seemed to be making was that a history of mental illness was the most likely predictor of people being unhappy in the future. Again, I didn\u2019t like this conflation of mental illness on the one hand, and unhappiness. Unhappiness is the lot of many people, there are very often very rational reasons why people are unhappy.  As I understand it, mental illness, particularly depression and anxiety, are conditions which medics are very well able to identify. Not least, because of the intensity of those conditions, the crippling nature of those conditions."

Every time anyone comes out now there\u2019s a kind of new one, or new syndromes that can be identified. The reason I get worried about it is I get concerned that there\u2019s a kind of advocacy research involved in this. Which is people who passionately care about getting support and resources for the mentally ill; the more that you can say that there are, the more help- It\u2019s always been a bit of an un-glamorous one schizophrenia and bipolar, do you know what I mean? So if you can kind of, broaden it out so there\u2019s that rather cynical, but well intentioned thing. But there\u2019s also this sense in which I do worry that people like Lord Layard think that those of us who are having a rough week, or are rightly dissatisfied and unhappy with our lot because we live in a rubbish society or whatever, need to go and see a therapist.  And I think that the thing for me is just that, people who suffer clinical depression, people who are about to go through an episode or are going through an episode, or people who have got bipolar or schizophrenia, it\u2019s the most horrible experience. It\u2019s very nasty. They often don\u2019t present, and they certainly wouldn\u2019t answer- you know, they could answer the 26 questions and tell you everything was fine.

A very high level, and it kind of begs the question \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be a reductionist \u2013 but why have we evolved as a race to have this incredibly high propensity to mental illness? Why would this have survived in the human gene, this kind of disfunctionality?  I think that there are very specific causes of greater vulnerability in particular areas in society. I don\u2019t think, as our second speaker suggested, that it\u2019s simply about grand power and class, I think there are very specific things going on.

I mean he seemed to be going out of his way to deny that there was any such thing as illness, mental illness. Hang on a minute, let me finish. He seemed to going out of his way to deny that there was a mental illness arising out of social problems. For example, his visceral reaction when I suggested that the mass fatherlessness that we\u2019re encountering was leading to real illness and disorder among children, produced a visceral reaction in which I was accused of pathologising single parenthood. But the fact is, that if you talk to child psychiatrists, there is a huge amount of, not just unhappiness among children, but an absolute disintegration of their identity.

Now what\u2019s almost happened is, having a badge of \u201cI\u2019m in need of a therapeutic intervention\u201d is not that embarrassing.
