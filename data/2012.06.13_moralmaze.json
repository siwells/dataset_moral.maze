The relief following the bail out for Spain's banks didn't even last the weekend. By Monday Spain's borrowing costs were unaffordably high again, the Eurozone back in the crisis it had never actually left.  Nationally, and individually, we're all drowning in debt. We wanted more than we could afford, and mortgaged the future to pay for it. Average household debt here is well over \u00a350,000. The Spaniards thought property was a lottery everybody could win. The Greeks wanted prosperity at other people's expense.  Now it's all come unstuck. We're flailing around trying to save the indebted from the consequences of their improvidence. The prudent are being punished to rescue the profligate. Taxpayers stump up to save banks. Savers are being ruined by cheap money being printed to ease the burden on borrowers.  This is as much a moral issue as high politics and shifty financial engineering.  There are still those that argue that money is a morally neutral token of exchange, to be manipulated in whatever way is expedient, and debt merely a mechanism for stimulating growth.  But the crisis has reinforced the more old fashioned view, that taking on unaffordable debts, nationally or individually, is inherently wrong, and bankruptcy a matter of shame.  Either way, how do you strike a moral balance between the interests of the lender and the borrower? The morality of money and debt is our moral maze tonight.  Our panel: the former Conservative cabinet minister Mr. Michael Portillo; Claire Fox, from the Institute of Ideas; the Catholic writer Clifford Longley; and Matthew Taylor, formerly Tony Blair's chief political advisor, and now chief executive of the R.S.A.  Michael Portillo, are you a saver or a debtor? And is there a moral distinction between the two?"

You didn't want to be a burden on the state.  Somehow there was an extraordinary sea change, in which acquiring debt not only lost the stigma that it had before but became actually the thing to do.

What struck me was I think three of the witnesses, coming from what I took to be different political positions, did arrive at the point that there has been an intervention here by government which is at the heart of the problem.  Simon Rose said we are jeopardising the savers and we are rewarding the borrowers.  Just now, of course, we had Jamie Whyte saying that subsidy, which is provided by government, is at the source of the problem.  But Nick Dearden too was talking about interest rates being the one price that was controlled by government.  So it's quite striking that all three witnesses, coming from very different positions, put their finger on that. And, by the way, I think they're absolutely right. "

And in this regard I think I would adopt a more kind of quasi Marxist position, in the sense that I think what has driven a great deal of the problems that we've got now is the need for capital to find new ways of making money.  And if the best way of making money is to encourage people to take out debts that they can't afford, the best way to make money is to encourage people to take out mortgages they can't afford, then that is what capitalism has reverted to.  And so we have a system dominated not by productive capitalism but by finance capitalism and consumer capitalism.
