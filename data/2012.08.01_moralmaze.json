Sport is fairer than real life.  So much is invested in these games, and I\u2019m not just talking about the \u00a39.5 billion, probably more, of our money. National pride of course, but also hopes for a healthier, more inclusive, more upbeat, even better off, Britain. Hopes seemingly hinged on a few fit people running round in circles, swimming up and down, bouncing on stuffed upholstery, chucking things.  Sport has always had a moral quotient. The Greeks and Romans regarded it both as noble in itself, and essential to the rounded man. Victorian public schools thought it shaped individual character. The founder of the modern Olympics wanted his games to spread peace and understanding amongst nations.  Philosophers on the football terraces - and which fan isn\u2019t \u2013 can still discern a morality play on the pitch. Villainy certainly, but courage, endurance, triumph, tragedy and redemption. Even in an age which has John Terry as a sporting hero.  \u201cWhat\u2019s he babbling about?\u201d I hear some of you cry. \u201cModern sport has been professionalised, it\u2019s driven by money, seduced by big corporations. Winning is all that matters, and then leveraging fame for profit.\u201d What exactly is the moral value of 21st century sport? Our \u201cMoral Maze\u2019, tonight. The panel: Melanie Philips, social commentator on the Daily Mail; Claire Fox, from the Institute of Ideas; Matthew Taylor, formerly Tony Blair\u2019s Chief Political Advisor, now Chief Executive of the RSA; and the science historian Kenan Malik.  Matthew Taylor, you\u2019re a \u2018Baggies\u2019 fan \u2013 that\u2019s West Bromwich Albion, now don\u2019t ask.  Are \u2018Baggies\u2019 morally uplifting?"

But nevertheless, there was morality very much a part of sport; that you not only improve your body, you not only be athletic, but you be a better person. Sometimes it can be exaggerated, but I think on the whole sport does have values. The example I gave is last year, when the Indian wicket keeper captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, not noted for Ghandian qualities, withdrew an appeal for a run out which was technically quite correct, because he felt it was ethically not good.

One of the major changes was- a great player that emerged was Baloo a so-called \u2018untouchable\u2019, or what Ghandi called \u2018Harijans\u2019 later. And this was a man coming from a community where historically, in India, a shadow of this person could be considered to foul, to be evil for the upper class Indians. Yet he became a major player.

You can also talk about nationalism in the way that we create a solidarity around the national Olympic team, for example.  Remember that, like nationalism, tribalism can be double edged, it often leads to great divisiveness between rival tribes. There has been violence; the same thing can happen at the national level where it morphs from nationalism, to a slightly more troubling Zenophobia, and that we think it confers a certain superiority over others.  I think it can be a healthy form of solidarity, but if you look historically and deconstruct what\u2019s actually happened, it can have negative connotations too."

At the end of the match you go down to the pub and you argue about it, or whatever it might be. In that sense sport allows us to express those kind of tribal things, but in a way which doesn\u2019t actually damage society. So it\u2019s a kind of outlet, and therefore in a sense it has a moral force; it allows us to express those kinds of needs that we have, but to do it in a way which isn\u2019t destructive in the way that, I don\u2019t know, fighting wars is."
