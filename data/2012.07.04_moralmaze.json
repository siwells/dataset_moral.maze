The substance of Barclays\u2019 disgrace is arcane, but clearly dishonest, the culture behind it - all those emails from \u2018big boy\u2019 to \u2018dude\u2019 - even worse; Barrow Boy Bollinger fuelled chiselling, light years removed form the Captain Mannering style fustiness of banking\u2019s past.  Bankers are the scapegoats du jour, but the ethics of many of our institutions are shaky \u2013 the MPs haranguing Diamond who are flinging stones in a glasshouse. The newspapers reporting it all are seemingly staffed by crooks and spies; Doctors strike over pensions that are much more generous than those of most of their patients.  Britain\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company, slogan: \u201cOpen and honest in all we do\u201d has just had to pay ten times the fine levied on Barclays, $3 billion, for marketing its drugs fraudulently and bribing doctors to use them a decade ago.  The answer we are told, is more and tighter regulation, to rebuild trust, but is it deeper than that? Have we as a society, not just bankers, become moral utilitarians, who\u2019s ethics are based merely on personal fulfilment? Do we really need more rules to behave better? Or, will that make us worse \u2013 reduce our moral agency to box ticking; makes our institutions less, rather than more trustworthy.  That\u2019s our \u2018Moral Maze\u2019 tonight. The panel: Melanie Philips, social commentator on The Daily Mail; the former Conservative Cabinet Minister, Michael Portillo; the Catholic writer Clifford Longley; and Matthew Taylor, formerly Tony Blair\u2019s chief political advisor, now Chief Executive of the RSA.  Michael Portillo, when you saw Bob Diamond on the television this afternoon, did you see a scapegoat? The unacceptable face of Capitalism, or a symptom of \u2018sick Britain\u2019?"

The second thing you touched on, that I do agree with, is management. Investment banks historically haven\u2019t invested in training their management, and that\u2019s a real problem. You take someone like Bob Diamond, in other industries he would have been sent off for two years to run branch banking so he knew more about it, before becoming a group Chief Executive.
