David Cameron called this week for a radical rethink of the welfare state, to go back to its first principals, and then deal with what he regards as its negative consequences.  There\u2019s a moral as well as political fault line running through all this. What exactly is the underlying principle of the welfare state? Relieving need? Achieving greater social justice? Or promoting virtue?  Above all, how negative have been the consequences? David Cameron says it\u2019s gone too far and provided perverse incentives that encourage people not to work, to have children they can\u2019t afford, and to become and continue to be, dependent on others. The currently fashionable juxtaposition of \u2018strivers\u2019 and \u2018skivers\u2019 is a clear echo of the Victorian distinction between the deserving and the undeserving poor.  Mr Cameron\u2019s opponents say the real picture is far more complex; the shiftless are a tiny proportion of those truly in need, and even if you target them, their children suffer.  Is it just a matter of getting the balance right between the prudent and the feckless? Between compassion and cost? Even now, between the young and the old? Welfare: what\u2019s fair? More to the point, what\u2019s right? That\u2019s our \u2018moral maze\u2019 tonight. The panel: Claire Fox, from the Institute of Ideas; Anne McElvoy, public policy editor of The Economist; the Catholic writer Clifford Longley; and the Science Historian Kenan Malik.  Clifford Longley, the polls seem to suggest that Cameron\u2019s concerns resonate with perhaps the majority? Does that majority include you?"

I see very great danger here of stirring up resentment towards people who need welfare to keep house and home together, and that\u2019s very dangerous to the solidarity, which civilization requires.  And there is what seems to be a fundamental anthropological mistake behind what\u2019s he\u2019s saying; he assumes that people are incentivised to remain unemployed, and you have to, as it were, bribe them into work. Whereas I think people are naturally creative and industrious, and want to work, they\u2019re not naturally lazy."

Unfortunately they can\u2019t.  Now you used the word \u2018incentive\u2019, and there are two different ways of improving the incentives to work. One is to change the balance of or the generosity of out of work beneifts, maybe spend more on in work benefits like tax credits and so on. Maybe we could turn our tax credits, which aren\u2019t really tax credits in the UK, into something you only get paid if you\u2019re working; that would be a good way of incentivising work. But we\u2019ve thought too much, funnily, about the financial incentives to work, and not enough about the conditionality in the system. What do we ask people to do in return for their benefits?  The idea of \u2018Work Fair\u2019, or of conditionality, is incredibly popular. About 80% of people support the idea that if you\u2019ve been on out of work benefits for more than a year, you should be asked to do community work in return for your benefits. And they are right about that, because we know that these programs from other countries, they work; they really reduce unemployment. In one of the US states that went the furthest in this in diverting people from being on welfare, they managed at one point to reduce the number of people on benefits by 90%. This is a huge opportunity that we\u2019ve barely begun to explore in the UK system."

So, imagine the welfare state did not exist and you became unemployed, and you rely on your friends and family to get by, and then someone comes along and offers you a job but it doesn\u2019t give you more money than your family and friends are going. We would still expect you to take that job, and that argument is even stronger if the people you\u2019re relying on are not your friends and family, but other people you don\u2019t even know."

But the system, if it has an impact, has an impact. And one of the things that I think has happened, and this is why I really disagree with Kenan. I don\u2019t think it is the equivalent of calling people feckless and lazy to say that a lot of young people today I\u2019m afraid, have become as it were, so dependent in a passive way on somebody else sorting things out for them, that they do say \u201cWhy should I take that job? I don\u2019t want to get up that early.\u201d That\u2019s not because I\u2019m trying to demonise young people, I think if we can\u2019t be honest about what\u2019s happening, and the sapping of morale \u2013 and we only saw riots last year with young people saying \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I have this?
