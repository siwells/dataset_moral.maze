A blunt civil servant Louise Casey, turned two generations of social policy on its head this week, calling for the return of shame, and arguing for the State to interfere more in how people choose to live their lives.  Social work used to be about families with problems. Now those families, it seems, are the problem. Louise Casey is meant to be the solution.  The Government says it\u2019s identified 120,000 troubled families, who are a particular burden on society, costing you and me \u00a39 billion a year in benefits, crime, antisocial behaviour and healthcare. As Casey heads a small army of social workers, and a \u00a3450 million budget to turn them round, she talks of guilt and responsibility. Of women with too many children who should be told in no uncertain terms, and with sanctions like losing council housing to back it up, that it\u2019s irresponsible to have more if they can\u2019t cope.  Her opponents are outraged. \u201cThe only thing the families have in common is poverty\u201d, they say. \u201cThey\u2019re being demonised for political reasons\u201d.  Even supposing Ms Casey is correct, and the Government has accurately identified these families as society\u2019s central problem, is reintroducing concepts of shame and guilt the right approach? Or a regression to a darker, less tolerant time? What business is it of the State to interfere in how even dysfunctional families live their lives? How slippery a slope is it if the State can tell us whether we should or shouldn\u2019t have children? Or, is our reluctance to make moral judgements about even the most disruptive amongst us, the real root of the problem? That\u2019s our \u2018Moral Maze\u2019 tonight. The panel: Melanie Philips, social commentator on The Daily Mail; Claire Fox, from the Institute of Ideas; Anne McElvoy, public policy editor of The Economist, and the science historian, Kenan Malik. Anne McElvoy; troubled families or troublesome families? Is that the crux of it?"

There are a lot of criminal activities, they\u2019re doing a lot of bad things, they\u2019re terrorising their neighbours.  I would take, and Family Action, a much broader view about who troubled families actually are. I would say \u201cYes, there are families that are in trouble, they are on the edges or actually committing crime, they are violent.\u201d But I would also say that there are two other brackets that I would bring within the troubled family scenario.  I think there\u2019s parents with mental health problems who have lost their ability to care for their children. The third category in my view would be the families who really have just lost their ability to parent for their children, perhaps they\u2019ve never had it, and they need help getting back on track."
